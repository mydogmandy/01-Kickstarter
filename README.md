 ### Challenge
 - May, June, & July are the best months to launch a successful theater campaign, but the number of successes decreases steadily after May:

- Over half of the total campaigns for plays had goals between $1,000 & $4,999, and also enjoyed a success rate over 70%
- The risk for failure grows greater as goals reach $30,000
- None of the theater play Kickstarter campaigns were canceled

The current dataset observed is limited to theater projects & plays, and does not include other catagories of Kickstarters.
Addtional graphs that may be useful would be:  

*Total theater projects for each goal total / Average donation amounts / Average number of backers to gauge popularity*
